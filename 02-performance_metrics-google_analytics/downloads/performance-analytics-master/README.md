# Measuring Critical Performance Metrics with Google Analytics

These are the resource files needed for the [Measuring Critical Performance Metrics with Google Analytics](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/performance-analytics/)
code lab from Google.

Each step in the code lab corresponds to an individual directory in this repository, so you can easily skip to any step to see the complete code changes up through that point.

This is a work in progress, if you find a mistake, please [file an issue](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/performance-analytics/issues). Thanks!
