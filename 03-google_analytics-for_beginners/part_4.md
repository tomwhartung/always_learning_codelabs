### 4.1.1 How to track a marketing campaign

- Marketing campaigns can be a combination of one or more of these techniques:
  - Text ads on search engine results
  - Banner ads on content sites
  - Social media
  - Email campaigns
- Google Analytics can use "campaign tagging" to track campaigns
  - Campaign tags are added to URLs used in online marketing and advertising
  - Google extracts information from these tags and associates them with users and their behaviors
- Example: Google Store sends a monthly email containing links to the Store
  - Adding an "email" campaign tag to these links enables identifying when users click on them
- Campaign tags:
  - Medium: the mechanism, e.g., "email", "cpc", "social"
  - Source: where user is from, depends on medium e.g., "google" or "yahoo" for cpc, or "newsletter" for email
  - Campaign: name of marketing campaign, e.g., "2015-Back-to-School" or "2017-Holiday-Sale"
  - Content: can differentiate between versions of a promotion, e.g., "v1-10dollars-off" or "v2-nopromo"
  - Term: keyword used with paid search engines (bing or yahoo, AdWords covered separately)
- URL Builder tool allows for adding these easily
