# TODO.md

This file lists changes I need to make to my sites in order to bring them up-to-date with the latest recommended techniques.

These changes are based on what I am learning by going through the Analytics Academy's Google Analytics for Beginners class.

# Changes Needed

## From Part 1 of the Google Analytics for Beginners Class

### From Part 1, Section 3 (1.3 Google Analytics setup):

- Move the tracking code snippet from the end of the file to just after the `<head>` tag.

### From Part 1, Section 4 (1.4 Demo):

- Create three views for each site, as demonstrated in this section:
  - Raw Data
  - Test View
  - Master View
- Create filter for my IP address in the Test View
- Test the filter
- Copy it to the Master View

## From Part 3 of the Google Analytics for Beginners Class

### From Part 3, Section 1 (3.1 Audience reports):

- In Analytics: Enable Demographics and Interest Reports:
  - Click Audience in left nav -> Demographics -> Overview
  - Click Enable and wait a day or two
  - OR: Admin -> Property tab -> Property Settings
  - Turn on "Enable Demographics and Interest Reports" -> Save
- Geographical: IP Address gives continent, sub-continent, country, city of user
  - Geographic heat map at top
  - Click on Users pull down, above and to the left of the map to change metrics
  - E.g., New Sessions can help identify new sources of visitors
  - Also: table below can help, e.g., identify regions with unrealized potential:
  - E.g., Large audience but low performance (many visits but they do not stay long)
  - E.g., High bounce rate: consider translating ad or site
- Behavior reports:
  - New vs. Returning: Acquisition, Behavior, Conversions
  - Over time, can reveal how audience is shifting
- Technology: Browser and OS, Network
  - High Bounce Rate: can help identify possible issues with site on certain browsers
- Mobile: Overview and Devices
  - Can help determine whether site is sufficiently optimized for mobile devices
