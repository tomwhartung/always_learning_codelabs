# TODO.md

This file lists changes I need to make to my sites in order to bring them up-to-date with the latest recommended techniques.

These changes are based on what I am learning by going through the Analytics Academy's Google Analytics for Beginners class.

# Changes Needed

## From Part 1 of the Google Analytics for Beginners Class

### From Part 1, Section 3 (1.3 Google Analytics setup):

- Move the tracking code snippet from the end of the file to just after the `<head>` tag.

### From Part 1, Section 4 (1.4 Demo):

- Create three views for each site, as demonstrated in this section:
  - Raw Data
  - Test View
  - Master View
- Create filter for my IP address in the Test View
- Test the filter
- Copy it to the Master View
